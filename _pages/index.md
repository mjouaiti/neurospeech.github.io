As disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative conditions start being promising, early detection becomes increasingly critical to detect people with neurodegeneration early. However, the current healthcare system is overwhelmed, with long wait times and the heterogeneity of quality of service across the country, a situation that is likely to get worse. It is therefore paramount to move some of the screening into the community by using digital spoken language biomarkers.

The workshop aims to bring speech researchers, clinicians and people with lived experience together to discuss challenges, and create a community.
