  N-CODE Hot Topic Workshop

  Tuesday 18 March - 9.30 - 16.00

As disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative conditions start being promising, early detection becomes increasingly critical to detect people with neurodegeneration early. However, the current healthcare system is overwhelmed, with long wait times and the heterogeneity of quality of service across the country, a situation that is likely to get worse. It is therefore paramount to move some of the screening into the community by using digital spoken language biomarkers.

The workshop will be in person only and aims to bring speech researchers, clinicians and people with lived experience together to discuss challenges, and create a community.

# Venue

The workshop will take place at the Edgbaston Park Hotel 

Edgbaston Park Hotel 
53 Edgbaston Park Rd 
Birmingham
B15 2RS

**Coming by train:**

University Station is a ten-minute walk from the hotel, and a two-minute walk from the centre of University of Birmingham’s campus.

The easiest way to get to the hotel is to walk past the University’s Main Library and Teaching and Learning Building (Ring Road North), up the hill towards North Gate on Pritchatts Road. Turn right and cross at the pedestrian crossing – the University’s iconic clocktower should be behind you.

Continue walking on Pritchatts Road until you see the entrance of the multi-storey North East Car Park. Turn left here and walk past the Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH). Edgbaston Park Hotel will be on your left.

**Coming by car:**

The hotel is 2.5 miles away from the city center.

Complimentary parking spaces available at Edgbaston Park Hotel, Hornton Grange Hotel, Garth House, Lucas House Hotel and the ground floor of the Pritchatts Road Car Park.
All guests must obtain a parking permit from out reception desks and display on the dashboard of each vehicle.
