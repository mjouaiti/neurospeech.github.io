# About Me
---
I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Birmingham, School of Computer Science. Before that, I was a Research Associate in the Biomechatronics lab at Imperial College London and UK Dementia Research Institute with Prof. Ravi Vaidyanathan. I was previously a Post-Doctoral fellow at SIRRL in University of Waterloo under the supervision of Prof. Kerstin Dautenhahn. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the Universit√© de Lorraine, Nancy, France.
I am interested in Robotics and AI. My work focuses mainly on Human-Robot Interactions in Healthcare (Robot-Assisted Therapy, Assistive robotics) and pathological speech.
